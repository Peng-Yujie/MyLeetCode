# BFS (Broad First Search)

**Basic idea:** explore the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.

## Traditional BFS

- start from the starting node to the target node

- [LeetCode 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](../0111-minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/0111-minimum-depth-of-binary-tree.py)

## Bidirectional BFS

- start from the starting node and the target node, and meet in the middle
