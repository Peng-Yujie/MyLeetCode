# Binary Tree

Two types of solutions:

- Is it possible to traverse the binary tree to get the answer?
- Is it possible to define a recursive function and use the result of the recursive function to get the answer?

Common concerns:

- What to do with each node?
- When to do it? (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
